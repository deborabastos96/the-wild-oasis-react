# The Wild Oasis

The Wild Oasis is a single-page application designed for a small boutique hotel featuring 8 luxurious wooden cabins. It allows them to manage all aspects of their hotel, including bookings, cabins, and guests.

This is an internal application that The Wild Oasis will use within the hotel to check in guests as they arrive.

The site was created using React + Vite, Styled Components, React Router, React Query, Context API, React Hook Form, React Icons, React Hot Toast, Recharts, date-fns, and Supabase.
